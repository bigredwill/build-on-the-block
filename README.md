# build on the block

A simple single page scoreboard for the Build on the Block 2023 contest put on by 35th North skateshop in Seattle, WA.

This is a Preact single page app (See /src/pages/Home.jsx). Completed quickly, it worked great for the contest.. Allows for user input and saves to local storage in case of lost connection or page refresh.

This was somewhat of an expirement in getting an minimum working product out that still looked good with little work put in. Using Preact cli, with vercel cli, the app was deployed and ready to go very easily. 10/10 would use this setup again.
